There is a base class called ‘Media’ and it has a method called play() that prints
“Playing media...”.



You need to create a derived class called ‘Song’ that inherits from the ‘Media’ class and adds
an additional attribute called artist (string). The Song class should override the play()
method to print the artist name along with the media play message like
“Playing song by $artist...'”.



In main() create one instance of Media and one of Song. Call their play() methods that print
proper messages.

Solution:
class Media {
  play() {
    print("Playing media...");
  }
}

class Song extends Media {
  String artist;
  Song(this.artist);
  @override
  play() {
    print("Playing song by $artist...");
  }
}

main() {
  Media obj = new Media();
  Song obj1 = new Song("Rokonujjaman");
  obj.play();
  obj1.play();
}
